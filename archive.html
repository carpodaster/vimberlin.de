  <p>
    Thanks for the countless coming, thanks for <a href="https://launchco.com/etc/#coworking">LAUNCH/CO</a> for
    giving us space, and thanks for the speakers Matthias, Stefan, and Drew for the various presentations.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can find the slides of Matthias Günthers talk "Notes - is there a best plugin?"

    <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/wikimatze/p/notes-is-there-a-best-plugin">at Speakerdeck.</a>
    Stefan Otte's talk about "vim-orgmode" was an additional talk about note taking with
    <a href="https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode/">vim-orgmode</a>.
    Drew Neil gave a very interesting talk about "Vim - Precision editing at the speed of thought" which he
    gave <a href="http://www.sourcedevcon.eu/">on the SourceDevCon 2012</a>, and showed the Vim hackers how
    work more with text object, and motions.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are sad to hear that Drew will leave Berlin and that our future meetups will be without him - we wish you
    all the best in England, and with his book <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will meet again on May 24th, 8 p.m. at the LAUNCH/CO coworking space. We
    would be glad, if you send talk proposals on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/vimberlin/">mailing list.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for coming
    Again, thanks for coming and making vimberlin happen. I've had great fun and
    learned a lot. I hope to see you all in May.

    <h2>Announcement: Third Meetup - 2012-05-24 - 08:00 p.m.</h2>
  </div>


  <p>I'm happy to announce the third vimberlin Vim user group meetup. We will meet on</p>

  <pre>
    May, 24th
    8:00 p.m.
    at <a href="https://launchco.com/etc/#coworking">LAUNCH/CO</a> (<a href="http://g.co/maps/k62eb">map</a>)</pre>

  <p>We currently have two and a half talks on the agenda:</p>

  <pre>
    Matthias Günther "Notes - is there a best plugin?"
    feat. Stefan Otte "vim-orgmode"
    Drew Neil "Vim - Precision editing at the speed of thought"</pre>

  <p>
    The rest will be some ad hoc and lightning talk style presentations about all
    things Vim. We count on your participation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks to LAUNCH/CO for hosting the event. I'm looking forward to seeing you
    there.
  </p>

  <p>Apologies, for posting the announcement a bit late this time.</p>

    <h3>Recap: Second Meetup - 2012-03-22</h3>
  </div>

  <p>
    First of all: Thank you all for coming, thanks to the two Matthiases for
    preparing and giving a talk and thanks to LAUNCH/CO for having us.
  </p>

  <p>
    The slides of Matthias Günther's talk "Lessons learned with Vimscript" may be
    found
    <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/wikimatze/p/lessons-learned-with-vimscript">at Speakerdeck</a>.
    Matthias Viehweger's talk was more ad-hoc a.k.a. lightning
    talk style, and he did not use slides. So if you are interested in his
    introduction to <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails">rails.vim</a> and the
    <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=356">Vim dbext plugin</a>
    you need to ask him in person.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've again had lots of interesting discussions about folding, navigation and
    other Vim best practices. In this context Matthias Günther mentioned his
    <a href="https://github.com/matthias-guenther/tocdown">tocdown plugin</a>,
    Drew Neil mentioned his
    <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/ftplugin/markdown/folding.vim">syntax highlighting for Markdown</a>, the
    <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles/tree/master/vim/bundle/vimoutliner">vimoutliner</a>
    and gave a quick explanation why he favors
    <a href="http://vimcasts.org/e/15">the default netrw file browser</a> over plugins like
    <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDtree</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Also Drew announced his two Berlin Vimcast Workshop on April 20th (
  [<a href="http://berlin-vimcasts-am-1.eventbrite.com/?discount=earlybird">1</a>],
  [<a href="http://berlin-vimcasts-pm-1.eventbrite.com/?discount=earlybird" >2</a>])
  at the LAUNCH/CO coworking space. Have a look at
  <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/02/what-to-expect-from-a-vimcasts-workshop/" >his introductory vimcast</a> to get an
    idea of what to expect.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will meet again on May 24th, 8 p.m. at the LAUNCH/CO coworking space. We
    would be glad, if you send talk proposals the mailing list.
  </p>

  <p>
    I encourage you to send pull request to the
    <a href="https://github.com/vimberlin/vimberlin.de">vimberlin GitHub repository</a> and
    add anything, that I might have missed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again, thanks for coming and making vimberlin happen. I've had great fun and
    learned a lot. I hope to see you all in May.

    <h3>Recap: First Meetup - 2012-01-26</h3>
  </div>

  <p>
    Thank you all for coming. It was a great evening and I had a lot of fun. I'm
    especially proud, that so many of you guys showed up. I think we were about 20
    people. I think, that's pretty impressive for a first meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would like to thank <a href="http://drewneil.com/" >Drew</a> for his thoughts
    on plugins and how they fit into the Vim universe. Also, playing some
    <a href="http://vimgolf.com/">vimgolf</a> was both entertaining and illuminating.
  </p>

  <p>
    Afterwards we were talking about our favorite plugins. I hope, we can still
    collect a list of all of them here for future reference. See the article above
    for more detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally we talked about vimberlin itself. We've settled to meet on the 4th
    Thursday of every odd month. So the next meetup will be on
  </p>

  <pre>March 22nd 2012 - 8 p.m. again at LAUNCH/CO</pre>

  <p>
    We are starting to using a mailing list to discuss talk proposals and other
    stuff. (There is a link at the top of the page.) I've also added a link to an
    iCal feed containing the schedule for the next meetups.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll continue to use the Twitter account
    <a href="http://twitter.com/vimberlin">vimberlin</a> for announcements and
    things of (potentially) general interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks Jan and LAUNCH/CO for hosting the event and providing us with chairs,
    beers and beamer and thank you all for making vimberlin happen.
  </p>

    <h2>Announcement: First Meetup - 2012-01-26 - 08:00 p.m.</h2>

  <p>
    The first vimberlin user group meetup will take place on Thursday, 26th January,
    at 8:00 p.m at the <a href="https://launchco.com/etc/#coworking">LAUNCH/CO coworking space</a>
    (<a href="http://g.co/maps/k62eb">map</a>).
  </p>

  <p>Topics for our first meetup will be:</p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://drewneil.com/">Drew Neil</a> (aka
    <a href="http://twitter.com/nelstrom">@nelstrom</a>), the creator of the awesome
    <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">vimcasts</a>, agreed to give a
    talk. We are very proud to have him at our very first meetup. The topic is yet
    to be announced.
  </p>

  <p>Further topics will be kind of organizational. We should briefly talk about:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Expectations for this user group </li>
    <li> Future schedule for regular meetups </li>
    <li> Future topics of meetups </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We will have some time at the end for small talk and socializing. Also, in
    Friedrichshain, it should be rather easy to move on to a bar after the meetup.
  </p>
