We will meet on:

<pre>

  7:00 pm
  3rd floor
  {% include launch_co_map.html %}

We currently have two talks on our agenda:


<ul>
    <li>
      <strong>"Multiediting"</strong>
      <br>
      Since Sublime Text became popular, a lot of people have been trying to replicate its "multiple cursors"
      functionality in Vim. Fortunately for us Vim-users, our editor doesn't really need this, since we have built-in
      ways to achieve pretty much the same results. Still, I believe the multi-edit plugins have some interesting
      properties and I want to demonstrate them and some of their benefits and drawbacks. I'll also talk about
      :substitute, :global and the dot mapping and share some tips and tricks that make them a simple alternative to
      mpultiple cursors. I'll finish up with demos of some of my own hacky experiments on this topic.
