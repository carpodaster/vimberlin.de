Our first beginners workshop in [August 2012](/august-2012-workshop) was a huge success. Around twenty people were learning
something new: Some of them learned the usage of the `vimrc`, others went through [vimtutor](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html), and some of them asked specific questions.

Iâ€™m happy to announce the second vimberlin beginners workshop. We will meet on:
