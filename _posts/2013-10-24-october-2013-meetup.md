We will gather around 7pm at the office and will start with the talks around 7.30pm - no need to huzzle around

## We have one talk on our agenda:


* **"Ways to extract cretain text-components"** by [Matthias GÃ¼nther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)

    There are these days at work where you have to solve certain problem but you know that this isn't the easiest way to
    do it. Let me explain you my thoughts about going through this experience.


If you want to show us your `vimrc` - you are pleased to do it.


You can find this event under [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/crqzz).


If you want to give a talk too, just let me know and I can you on the agenda. Just drop us a line on twitter or via
mail.
