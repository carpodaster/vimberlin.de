We have two talks on our agenda:


<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"Browsing a codebase with ctags"</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimatze">Matthias GÃ¼nther</a>
    <br>
    I was always asking myself how I can browse a code base of bigger written ruby library. I want to share with you
    what I did and what my current work flow looks like.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"Profiling Vim"</strong> by <a href="http://feitel.indeedgeek.de/">Florian Eitel</a>
  </li>
</ul>


You can find this event under [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/crdqc).


If you want to give a talk too, just let me know and I can put it on the agenda.
