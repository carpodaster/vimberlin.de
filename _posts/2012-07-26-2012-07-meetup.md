# Recap

Due to vacations, this meetup was a bit more intimate than usual. This led to interesting discussions about the future
work of the user group. One outcome was the announcement of regular VIM Novice workshops, which will be a great
opportunity to learn the first steps in Vim and connnect with fellow vimers.
